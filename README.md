##Ardoq test

## Part 1

"Create a method that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product
between 3 of those numbers. Example: [1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] = 300"


Please provide tests that show your solution actually works.



##Part 2

I went for 2c - "Create a simple chatbot using whichever service or framework you prefer"

*The chatbot should include at least 2 commands.

*One of the commands should give a follow-up question.

*One of the commands should give an answer from a public API (i.e. Yr,
Coindesk, The Internet Chuck Norris Database, ...)

*The chatbot should be able to store an answer the user gives and use it
another question/response

*In your submission, include a sample conversation

*In your submission, include a sentence about why you chose a specific
service/framework to solve this task

*We should be able to test your submission on our end so include a readme
with setup instructions
